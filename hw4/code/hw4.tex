\begin{homeworkProblem}
% \Answer \\
\section*{(1)}
Use the linear property of expectation and expand the square of $E_{COM}$:
\begin{align*}
  E_{COM} = \frac{1}{M^2} (\sum_{m=1}^M \mathbb{E}_x[\epsilon(x)]^2 + 2 \sum_{m \neq l}^{M} \mathbb{E}_x[\epsilon_m(x) \epsilon_l(x)])
\end{align*}
All prediction model errors are zero-mean and uncorrelated, so the latter part disappears:
\begin{align*}
  E_{COM} = \frac{1}{M^2} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbb{E}_x[\epsilon(x)]^2 
\end{align*}
We notice:
\begin{equation*}
  E_{AV} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbb{E}_x[\epsilon(x)]^2 
\end{equation*}
Therefore:
\begin{equation*}
  E_{COM} = \frac{1}{M} E_{AV}
\end{equation*}

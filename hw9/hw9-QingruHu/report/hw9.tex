  For the 2th layer:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial y} &= -(z_2 - y)\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2} &= z_2 - y\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_2} &= \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial a_2} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2} = W_2 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial W_2} &= \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial W_2} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2} = a_2 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial b_2} &= \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial b_2} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2} = \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_2}
\end{align*}

For the 1th layer:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1} &= \frac{\partial a_2}{\partial z_1} \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_2} = g'(z_1) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_2} = H(z_1) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_2}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_1} &= \frac{\partial z_1}{\partial a_1} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1} = W_1 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial W_1} &= \frac{\partial z_1}{\partial W_1} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1} = a_1 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial b_1} &= \frac{\partial z_1}{\partial b_1} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1} = \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_1}
\end{align*}

For the 0th layer:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} &= \frac{\partial a_1}{\partial z_0} \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_1} = g'(z_0) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_1} = H(z_0) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_1}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_0} &= \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial a_0} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} = W_0 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} \\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial W_0} &= \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial W_0} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} = a_0 \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0}\\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial b_0} &= \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial b_0} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} = \frac{\partial J}{\partial z_0} \\
  \frac{\partial J}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial a_0}{\partial x} \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_0} = g'(x) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_0} = H(x) \frac{\partial J}{\partial a_0} \\
